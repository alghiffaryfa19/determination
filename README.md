# Aurora

Android convergence layer for Android 16

Android stays PID1; a Wayland desktop runs as an LXC guest
on the **same downstream vendor kernel**; `libhybris` bridges the guest to the
bionic GPU/display blobs. Shipped as a custom `boot.img` (custom kernel +
Magisk-patched ramdisk) plus a Zygisk module : **not a ROM** (though can be adapted as such) - `/system` and
`/vendor` stay stock.




- **Internal on-demand desktop*: SF is stopped and
  respawn-masked, the guest compositor takes the panel via hwcomposer, input is
  handed off with `EVIOCGRAB`.





## PC installation and porting

Launch `./aurora-installer` on a Linux PC to start the linear porting and
installation interview. It asks one validated question at a time for device
discovery, verified releases, kernel builds, device bundle generation,
installation, and PC-held boot backups. The Android companion controls the installed desktop;
it no longer downloads or installs system artifacts.

See the [workbench guide](installer/README.md) for host setup and the complete flow.

## Repo layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `recon/` | §9 device recon : run first, with the phone attached |
| `kernel/` | kconfig fragment (container enables) + fetch/build scripts for the downstream SM8150 kernel |
| `boot/` | boot.img unpack/repack with the custom kernel; Magisk patching flow |
| `magisk-module/` | the on-device Aurora Magisk module: container launch, boot hooks, sepolicy rules |
| `guest/` | Debian baseline plus experimental Arch Linux ARM/Alpine rootfs builders; shared LXC, libhybris, and session contract |
| `toggle/` | §4 internal-panel handoff: SF stop + respawn suppression + compositor swap + input grab; plus `aurora-hostagent` (guest→host control channel) |
| `control/` | native `aurorad` state/API owner, `auroractl` client, durable-state/protocol core, and host tests |
| `audio/` | direct ALSA hardware and ownership binaries |
| `companion/` | Android UI and permission facade: mode confirmation, status/API, Quick Settings, share sheet, optional external presenter |
| `tools/evgrab/` | small C daemon that holds `EVIOCGRAB` on evdev nodes during desktop mode |
| `installer/` | Terminal interview, automatic kernel porting, verified bundles, installation, and recovery |
| `usb-install/` | Legacy device-specific host flashing helper |
| `zygisk/` | Zygisk/LSPosed module for `system_server` hooks |
| `docs/` | Current wiki: guides, architecture, reference, operations, qualification, and separated history |

## Validation

Run host-runnable behavioral tests from the repository root:

```sh
./tools/check-host.sh
```

Run static repository, documentation, generated-index, and release-metadata
hygiene separately:

```sh
./tools/check-repo.sh
```

With a Aurora desktop already running on an attached phone, run the
non-destructive live acceptance pass separately:

```sh
./tools/check-device.sh
```

The host suite does not qualify a physical device.

## Licensing

Aurora's original code is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE). Components we build,
vendor, or modify retain their own licences; see
[third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) and the verbatim texts in
[`LICENSES/`](LICENSES/) before redistributing a boot image, guest rootfs, module
ZIP, or APK.



## Linux-first profile (experimental)

Supported device profiles can request a Linux-first startup while
retaining the minimum Android and vendor services needed for the downstream
kernel, radio, thermal, power, binder, and qualified networking stack:

```sh
aurora linux-first status
aurora linux-first enable
aurora linux-first apply
aurora linux-first disable
```

. See the
[boot-profile reference](docs/reference/device-and-boot-profiles.md) and
[recovery guide](docs/guides/install-and-recovery.md) before enabling it.

## Bring-up order (risk-ordered milestones)



## Guest SSH

The guest SSH server is public-key-only. The host routes the private guest
subnet through the phone's current Wi-Fi address, giving the container a real
directly reachable address:

```sh
aurora ssh-setup                    # server, public key, SSH config, host route
ssh aurora@192.168.117.2        # exactly this; no ProxyCommand
aurora ssh-route                    # refresh after phone DHCP or host route changes
aurora motd-setup                   # refresh the guest's dynamic login banner
```

Pass an existing public key to `aurora ssh-setup` if preferred. Set
its matching private key in `~/.ssh/config.d/aurora` when it is not the
default dedicated `~/.ssh/aurora_ed25519` key.

## Status

- [x] Repo scaffolding, recon script, kernel fragment, Magisk module, guest
      builder, toggle scripts, evgrab
- [x] Recon on real device over wireless adb → `docs/recon-findings.md`
      (crDroid 12.10/A16, HIDL composer 2.4, gralloc4, binderfs present,
      DP-alt works)
- [x] Kernel built (crDroid 16.0 tree + running config + fragment, 3m13s),
      `boot/aurora-boot.img` repacked from the dumped boot_b and verified
- [x] Module zip packaged with static aarch64 evgrab; `./aurora` host helper
- [x] Cable-free install path: `usb-install/` action zips + `./aurora publish`
      (flash via Magisk app + `dd`; rescue from a *bootloop* still needs a cable)
- [x] **FLASHED AND BOOTING** (2026-07-02, via the USB-drive path): kernel
      `4.14.357-perf-g96adfa8256dc` live on device, PID/USER/IPC_NS confirmed.
      WiFi initially exposed a `qca_cld3_wlan.ko` vermagic mismatch; the current
      kernel build carries the matching module directly, so the old Magisk WLAN
      overlay has been retired. Full hardware smoke test green. Aurora
      module installed. Milestone 1 done.
- [x] Guest rootfs + libhybris smoke test on guacamoleb (2026-07-04, TLS wall
      cleared with upstream libhybris; `test_hwcomposer` GLES 3.2 on the panel)
- [x] wlroots on the panel: phoc + phosh + squeekboard live, touch-verified
      (2026-07-06/07); GPU app buffers zero-copy path working (2026-07-10)
- [x] Toggle round trip cable-free: companion app Enter, guest launchers /
      phosh power menu Exit, verified on-device (2026-07-11) : milestone 4 done
      (QS tile confirmed)
- [x] Milestone 5 phase 1: native graphics/KMS path proven (2026-07-13/14) :
      Turnip on KGSL, minigbm allocation, dmabuf→Vulkan import, raw DSI KMS
      scanout, and Plasma Mobile under KWin with GPU compositing + touch.
      This is retained as an explicit native-Mesa experiment, not the portable
      product renderer.
respectively..
- [ ] Milestone 5 phase 2: concurrent external convergence : Android/SF keeps
      the panel while a guest-rendered dmabuf is presented on DP-alt
- [x] Direct audio : the internal-speaker alpha is hardware-proven on
      `guacamoleb` (2026-08-02): journalled Android ownership, direct ALSA and
      PipeWire playback, normal desktop lifecycle integration, etc
